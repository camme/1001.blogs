#Part II: A basic nodejs plugwise API

!!!
My espresso machine (Rancilio Silvia) takes about 45 minutes to warm up, which means that I need to tell the machine to switch on when I’m on my way home from work.

Yesterday I wrote a blogpost at 24hr.se about controlling plugwise connected appliances with nodejs. Its kind of Part II of my previous post about one of my sideprojects (to control my espresso machine automagically before I get home).I’ve also shared the code at github, so please read the post and head up to github to try it out.
